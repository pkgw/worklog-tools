BEGIN_SUBST cite_stats
|adslink| citation counts are shown in square brackets and were last updated
around |monthstr|~|day|,~|year|. As of then, I was an author on |refpubs|
refereed publications (|reffirstauth| as first author), my |italich|-index
was |hindex| and my refereed publications had |refcites| citations.
